## üìù Notes

**Design Principles**
- Local-first, cloud-optional
- Developer experience > feature count
- Performance > convenience
- Security by default
- Extensible everywhere

**Success Metrics**
- Time to first flow: < 5 minutes
- Node development time: < 30 minutes
- Community nodes: 100+ in 6 months
- GitHub stars: 1000+ in year 1
